    <h2>My Bio</h2>
  <img src="/static/images/piero.JPG" />
    <p>
      Personally bio's are a struggle for me to write mostly because I have yet to figure myself out. I'm a chemistry major at Drexel <br>
      University, currently a second year student. My work keeps be busy much throughout the day and because of this I developed a stern work ethic,<br>
      priorizing my duties over everything else. However, I am not a lifeless machine, I enjoy whatever time I have with others, <br>
      afterall the best momements on this world are those you can enjoy with others. In this website you should have a pretty good idea of my personality,<br>
      goals, hobbies, and much more.
